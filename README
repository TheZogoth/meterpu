Heterogeneous computing systems expose different programming APIs for measuring metrics of interest, such as execution time or energy usage. MeterPU is a C++ template library that provides a simple, uniform measurement API that is both device independent and generic in the metric to be measured. The actual, platform-specific measurement functionality can be specified for each platform by plug-ins.

If you use MeterPU for a publication, you should cite it as

@article{Lu-meterpu-journal,
  author = {{Lu Li, Christoph Kessler}},
  journal = {Journal of Supercomputing},
  title = {{MeterPU: A Generic Measurement Abstraction API Enabling Energy-tuned
Skeleton Backend Selection.}},
  year = {2016},
  url = {http://www.ida.liu.se/~lilu09/2.ppt/2015/repara_ppt.pdf},
  publisher = {Springer},
  doi = {10.1007/s11227-016-1792-x},
  pages = {1--16}
